For this Part I was using ECJ 25.
(InteliJ)


The libraris I was using is included in the packge I upload. It is named as libraris in the package.

To run the program, you need to change the file path for both training path and test path.(The test fild named as test.txt and the training file named as training.txt)

After load the package into InteliJ you need to set ecj as Source file. And set the packages in the libraris folder as libraris.

Then you should be able to build the project correctly.

To run it, you need to create a new java application, and use ec.Evolve as main class, and -file ec.app.tutorial4.params  -p gp.tree.print-style=c

The output data you can find in folder part3 it should named as out.stat
