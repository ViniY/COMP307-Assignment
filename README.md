# COMP307-Assignment
All the assignments I have done in this course.
Assignment 1 the code part was done in Python 3.7(Using python is much easier than using Java)
Assignment 2 which is the assignment based on GP, the code part was done in Java and the package was used is Ecj25.
(Ecj 25 is quite different with the new released ones like ecj26) all the libraris are included in the folder.
Assigment 3 the code part was done in Python (Very short)
Assigment 4 incldues no code.

You are more than welcome to look into my code, but dont just copy and paste, it do no goods to your own study.
